# Always-On Overlay with Tray Icon
A lightweight Python overlay built with Tkinter and pystray that displays the current time and allows you to toggle clickability, always-on-top mode, and window focus directly from a system tray icon.

## Application Purpose
This application was created to provide an easy way to monitor the current time while watching movies or TV shows in full-screen mode. Its unobtrusive on-screen overlay ensures you can keep track of time without interrupting your viewing experience.

**Note:** This program was generated with the help of a Large Language Model (LLM).
